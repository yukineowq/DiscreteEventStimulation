# Discrete Event Simulator

## Purpose

A discrete event simulator is a software that simulates a system with events and states, and can be used to study
many complex real-world systems. An event occurs at a particular time, and each event alters the states of the system
and may generate more events. States remain unchanged between two events (hence the term discrete), and this
allows the simulator to jump from the time of one event to another. A simulator typically also keeps track of some
statistics to measure the performance of the system.

The purpose of this project aims to prototype a queuing system comprising a single customer queue and single service point, 
whereby given a set of customer arrival times in chronological order, this will output the discrete events and statistics at the
end of the simulation.
